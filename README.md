TODO
----

* select3 Datasets that are big, contain lots of features and where each feature has a different representation
* use 5 different machine learning algorithms on these datasets and write about the results

In the question if we should use 5 algorithms on each 3 datasets, I think we only have to use 5 algorithms, each on one of 3 selected data sets.
